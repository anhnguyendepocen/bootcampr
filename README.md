## Course Material
Presentations, R code, and datasets will be available from the course GitHub repository:

https://www.github.com/collinmmccabe/bootcampR

This will be updated before each day of class with the day’s notes and code, so make sure to pull
from the master branch before each class. You will also be free to create your own branch on this
repository to keep track of your progress throughout the course.

## Instructor Availability
I will do my best to be around during the hackathon and code sprint to answer any questions or
solve any problems that might arise. If, however, I’m not around and you can’t figure something
out, feel free to email your questions to me at collinmichaelmccabe@gmail.com – I’ll respond to
your query within 24 hours. If your question involves some sort of bug in your code, please attach
the code in question along with any data you’re using to the email.
