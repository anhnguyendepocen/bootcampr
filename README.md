## Course Material
Presentations, R code, datasets, and take-home exercises will be available from the course GitHub repository:

[https://www.github.com/collinmmccabe/bootcampr](https://www.github.com/collinmmccabe/bootcampr)

This will be updated before each day of class with new versions of the day’s notes, code, and take-home exercises, so make sure to pull from the master branch before each class. You will also be free to create your own branch on this repository and into it from master to keep track of your progress throughout the course (Don't worry if you don't know what this means yet, you will after the first day of class).

## Instructor Availability
I will do my best to be around during the hackathon and code sprint to answer any questions or solve any problems that might arise. If, however, I’m not around and you can’t figure something out, feel free to email your questions to me at [collinmichaelmccabe@gmail.com](mailto:collinmichaelmccabe@gmail.com) – I’ll respond to your query within 24 hours. If your question involves some sort of bug in your code, please attach the code in question along with any data you’re using to the email.
